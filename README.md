# orbital
A program which uses OSP (Open Source Physics) to simulate Kepler's three laws:
Kepler's Laws:
 *  1. Planets orbit in elliptical orbits (graph the ellipse it should be)
 *  2. Equal areas are swept away in equal times (i.e. max velocity will be closest to the sun and min will be furthest)
 *  3. T^2(years) = a^3 (AU -> semi-major axis of the earth's orbit of the sun)
